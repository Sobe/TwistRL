=======

A rogue-like game with Ruby and Gosu.

*IT'S CURRENTLY ABSOLUTELY NOT FINISHED!*


#### Tiles

If you want to test it anyway, you will need some tiles in /media directory (I didn't commit mine here cause they're quite awfull, and some are from other games...).
This is the list of needed tiles, all 32*32 pixels, with _.png_ extension, and some transparency for player. Names are explicit... I hope.

herse_v_closed

herse_v_opened

herse_h_opened
